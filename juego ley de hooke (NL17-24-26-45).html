  <h2> 𔘓 WHO CREATED HOOKE'S LAW? 𔘓</h2>
   Robert Hooke (1635–1703) was an English scientist who excelled in various fields such as physics, biology, astronomy, and architecture. He is mainly known for formulating the Law of Elasticity, also called Hooke's Law.'<br><br>
   Robert Hooke discovered Hooke's law because:
   <ol>
<li><strong>He studied how materials deform when a force is applied to them.</strong></li><

<li><strong>He wanted to improve mechanisms and structures using that knowledge.</strong></li>

<li><strong>He was looking for a universal law that explained elasticity.</strong></li>
</ol>

  <h2>꩜ WHAT IS HOOKE'S LAW? ꩜</h2>
  <p>
   Hooke's Law, formulated by the English scientist Robert Hooke in 1660, describes the elastic behavior of bodies when a force is applied to them. This law states that "the deformation of a body is directly proportional to the applied force, as long as the elastic limit of the material is not exceeded."<br>

  <h2> 𔘓 FORMULAS 𔘓</h2>
  <p>
   The general and most complete formula of Hooke's law is the following: <br>
   <strong> F=K (X-X0)</strong><br><br>
   secondary formulas:<br>
    <strong>
    F/K= X: ---It is used to calculate how much a spring stretches or compresses according to the applied force and its elastic constant.<br><br>

    F/X= K ---It is used to calculate how stiff or flexible a spring or elastic material is.<br><br>

    F= K * X ---It is the basic form of Hooke's Law, used to calculate the force of a spring by measuring the deformation from its equilibrium position.<br>
  </strong><br>
     Where:<br>
   <strong>F</strong> it is the applied force.<br>
   <strong>K</strong> it is the elastic or stiffness constant of the material.<br>
   <strong>X</strong> it is the resulting deformation.<br><br>

  <h2> 𔘓 Where is Hooke's Law present in daily life? 𔘓</h2>
  <p>
   Hooke's Law may seem very theoretical, but it has many practical applications in daily life, since almost everything we use deforms and returns to its original shape. <br>
   This law is present in many aspects of everyday life.<br>
    <h4>✮<strong>Mattress, pen, and car springs work properly.</strong></h4>
    <h4>✮<strong>Engineers build safe buildings and bridges.</strong></h4>
    <h4>✮<strong>It also applies to technological devices such as microphones or speakers.</strong></h4>
    <p>
    In summary, this law allows the design of safe, comfortable, and functional objects that deform and return to their original shape.

  <h2> ꩜ When is the total of Hooke's law lost? ꩜</h2>
  <p>formation of an elastic material is proportional to the applied force, but only up to the elastic limit. If this limit is exceeded, the material deforms permanently (plastically) and no longer returns to its original shape, so Hooke's Law no longer applies. In other words, Hooke only describes elastic behavior; outside this range, the linear force-deformation relationship disappears.

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>
Hooke's Law allows us to understand how elastic materials stretch or compress when a force is applied to them. With it, we can calculate the deformation, the stiffness of springs, and the energy they store. This law is very useful in daily life and in engineering because it helps us design safe, strong, and functional objects and structures.
